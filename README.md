# C-Password-Server
C++ password server built to demonstrate the power of using a hashtable for random access of key/value pairs, where keys are usernames and the value is an encrypted password.

Using <i>make all</i>, two executable files will be made: <b>proj5.x</b> and <b>sproj5.x</b>. The latter will hide password input while its being entered.
I've written in the following functions: load users from a file, add users from a file, write users to a file, remove a user, change user password (requires user's old password), find if a user is in the password server, and "dump" hashtable to show all users and encrypted passwords,
